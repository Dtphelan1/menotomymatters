    "insertcomment": "The Arlington Heights business district was established when the primary means of transportation was a streetcar line running down Massachusetts Ave., rather than the widespread use of private automobiles. As such, buildings housing commercial establishments were constructed without consideration for off-street parking. Under the current bylaw, it would be virtually impossible for a new business to meet this requirement if it were situated on the north side of the block bordered by Park Avenue on the West, and Davis Rd. on the East. \n\n The Town has expressed a strong desire for three vigorous business districts in the East, Arlington Center,and Arlington Heights. In past years,a number ofb usinesses have closed in the Heights business district, and the current parking bylaw makes it challenging for new businesses to enter the area. We believe that changing the existing bylaw would aid in encouraging the development of new businesses, and helping to create a vibrant and diverse commercial community in Arlington Heights."
