It remains the position of this Office that a straightforward form of such a discount programs may be offered by vote of the Select Board without Town Meeting action or Home Rule Petition. However, further research has revealed that Home Rule Legislation would be required if the Board were to contemplate a model of discount similar to the Board’s recent means-tested tax deferral and “work-off” programs or to certain specific subcategories of senior residents in Arlington, based upon the Department of Revenue’s interpretation of Brand v. Water Commissioners of Billerica, 242 Mass. 223 (1922). Accordingly, it may be in the Board’s interest to place an article on the warrant for further discussion.",

The overall purpose of these ordinances is to take action to reduce carbon emissions in response to the climate change crisis.

As such, buildings housing commercial establishments were constructed without consideration for off-street parking. Under the current bylaw, it would be virtually impossible for a new business to meet this requirement if it were situated on the north side of the block bordered by Park Avenue on the West, and Davis Rd. on the East. \n\n The Town has expressed a strong desire for three vigorous business districts in the East, Arlington Center,and Arlington Heights. In past years,a number of businesses have closed in the Heights business district, and the current parking bylaw makes it challenging for new businesses to enter the area. We believe that changing the existing bylaw would aid in encouraging the development of new businesses, and helping to create a vibrant and diverse commercial community in Arlington Heights."
