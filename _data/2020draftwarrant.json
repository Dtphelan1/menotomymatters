Under the current bylaw, it would be virtually impossible for a new business to meet this requirement if it were situated on the north side of the block bordered by Park Avenue on the West, and Davis Rd. on the East. \n\n The Town has expressed a strong desire for three vigorous business districts in the East, Arlington Center,and Arlington Heights. In past years,a number of businesses have closed in the Heights business district, and the current parking bylaw makes it challenging for new businesses to enter the area.
