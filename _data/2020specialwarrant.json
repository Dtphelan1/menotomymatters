The overall purpose of these ordinances is to take action to reduce carbon emissions in response to the climate change crisis.

The petitioner also proposed referring to usable open space and landscaped open space as primary and secondary yard space, respectively. This differs from open space included in the Open Space District on the Zoning Map. Open Space in the Open Space District includes parcels under the jurisdiction of the Park and Recreation Commission, Conservation Commission, Arlington Redevelopment Board, Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, or Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This open space has a public benefit compared to private open space.\n\n  The ARB appreciates the intention of the petitioner to clarify who benefits from open space on private property (the landscaped open space and the useable open space), which is designed to benefit the owner and occupants of private property, compared to public open space. However, the ARB noted that 'open space' is a term of art that municipalities use in Zoning Bylaws and Ordinances throughout the Commonwealth. The ARB suggested that using 'private open space' would be a better option than 'yard space' to remain consistent with the term of art. The ARB is concerned that departing from the generally accepted term for describing private open space on a parcel would create confusion among users of Arlington’s Zoning Bylaw. As such, the ARB did not believe that the wording proposed is the solution to describe the differences between private open space and public open space.",

    "boardcomment": "The petitioner indicated that the implementation of Title VI, Article 7 of the Town Bylaw, the Arlington Residential Construction Agreement, also known as the “Good Neighbor Agreement”, has been inconsistent. The Good Neighbor Agreement, adopted by Town Meeting in 2017 and amended in 2019, applies to residential construction, including demolitions, open foundation excavation, new construction, and large additions, and requires notification by the contractor or property owner to abutters within a set period of time prior to any activities that may trigger the bylaw, including tree removal. The Good Neighbor Agreement establishes certain construction standards that must be maintained throughout the construction period. The addition of a cross reference in the Zoning Bylaw would improve implementation of the Good Neighbor Agreement.\n\n    The ARB found this addition to the Zoning Bylaw was unnecessary (in part because Title VI, Article 7, already contains the requirement that a demolition permit or building permit not issue until the requirements of that article are met) and determined that the proposed language does not align with the Town Bylaw. The ARB is concerned that this language may result in the application of the Good Neighbor Agreement to more projects than what the Town Bylaw indicates is required to comply with the Good Neighbor Agreement. The ARB recommended revising the language of Title VI, Article 7, to improve the implementation of the Good Neighbor Agreement before considering revising the Zoning Bylaw.",

    "boardcomment": "The petitioner explained that this article, to allow the two-family and duplex use in the R0 and R1 districts, should be adopted for four key reasons: addressing the racist legacy of single-family zoning in Arlington; improving environmental sustainability; increasing housing choice; and allowing for more affordable homes. The petitioners pointed to a number of actions that allowed Arlington to develop into a community consisting of predominantly single-family homes occupied by white owners, and proposed this article as a way to reverse previous actions.\n\n    The ARB believes that this article can address the important issues that the petitioner refers to in the presentation. The ARB also believes that it is important for the Town of Arlington to consider the past actions of both the Town and private entities, reflect on those actions, and determine a way to mitigate and reverse those actions. The ARB understands that this article reflects a larger policy conversation that the town should have, and is interested in hearing from Town Meeting Members on this topic after hearing a wide variety of opinions during the course of public dialogues. However, in addition to other concerns about the proposal, the ARB recognizes that there is no clear understanding of the impact of similar rezonings due to the recent nature of similar zoning changes in other States and there was no public engagement regarding this article.\n\n    The ARB discussed changes to the proposed motion that would improve the article and potentially address topics heard during the public hearings. Those items include:\n\n    1. Requiring that any two-family or duplex home that is built appears as a single-family home;\n    2. Codifying certain design requirements to maintain the appearance of a single-family home as well as minimizing changes that may alter the streetscape view; and\n    3. Capturing the value gained by building two homes versus one home by requiring a percentage payment to a municipal affordable housing trust fund based on the sales price or assessed value.\n\n    The ARB recognized that regulating appearance is a subjective proposition and the language of these three points would need further research and review that would be difficult to complete within the timeframe for Special Town Meeting. As such, the majority of the ARB recommended no action on this article and referred the topic to the Department of Planning and Community Development to identify an existing or new study committee for further study. The minority opinion believed that the right course of action would be to allow Town Meeting discussion on the article prior to referring the topic for further study.",

    "boardcomment": "The petitioner indicated that the article is substantially different that the ARB’s 2019 warrant article, which was short nine votes and failed at Town Meeting. The petitioner noted that the primary difference between these articles is that this one allows accessory dwelling units (ADUs) by-right in any residential zoning district. The ARB’s article proposed ADUs by Special Permit in the R0 and R1 residential zoning districts. The petitioner indicated that allowing ADUs in the community would be beneficial in four main ways: providing flexibility for families, as needs change over time; increasing range of housing choices; providing a form of housing generally less costly and more affordable than similar units in multifamily buildings; and adding units to Arlington’s total housing stock with minimal effects on neighborhoods.\n\n    The ARB agrees that this article is substantially different from the 2019 article. However, the ARB does not believe that this article is the best vehicle to allowing ADUs in Arlington. The ARB believes that there is inconsistency and ambiguity in the proposed motion. Further, the petitioner wrote the article in such a way that makes it difficult to revise while staying within scope. The ARB strongly supports the as-right basis of this article. However, there are a number of items from the 2019 article that the ARB might want to see included in an ADU bylaw such as requiring that one of the units is owner-occupied, limiting the gross floor area of the ADU at a percentage lower than 50%, and prohibiting short-term rentals.\n\n    The ARB also discussed a proposal presented by the public during the hearing, required that the rent charged for the non-owner-occupied unit not exceed an affordable rent as defined the Zoning Bylaw. The ARB disagrees with this approach to creating ADUs. The ARB discussed a similar proposal in 2019 and maintains that this requirement would have unintended consequences including being burdensome to the owner and resulting in few if any ADUs constructed as a result. A majority of the ARB members voted no action on this article and discussed submitting an article at a future Town Meeting following public review that will incorporate many of the best elements of this article and the 2019 article. The minority opinion believed that no action continues to delay meaningful progress in the town increasing a range of housing choices.",

At our Committee hearing, the Capital Planning Committee indicated that there are three primary drivers of the cost increase: $4.7 million is caused by construction industry cost inflation; $2.7 million is caused by a change in contracting method (Construction Manager at Risk and an increase in contingencies) which will work to contain future cost increases; and $1.5 million is caused by an increase in project scope, specifically moving the IT and Facilities Departments to the location, and the addition of concrete walls for the salt shed.  The IT and Facilities scope change represents a transfer of cost from the voter-approved exempt Arlington High School Project Budget to the non-exempt Capital Budget.\n\n   At our hearing, Finance Committee members expressed concern about the increase in project cost and the $400,000 in annual cuts that will happen in the Capital Budget to keep it in balance. Given these concerns, a future request for more funding could be met by opposition from the Finance Committee\n\n  **Vote Language:**\n\n   That the Town appropriates eight million, nine hundred thousand dollars ($8,900,000) to pay costs of remodeling, reconstructing, or making extraordinary repairs to the DPW Yard and associated buildings, including original equipment and landscaping, paving and other site improvements incidental or directly related to such remodeling, reconstruction or repair, and that to meet this appropriation, the Treasurer, with the approval of the Select Board, is authorized to borrow said amount under and pursuant to G.L. c. 44, §7(1) or any other enabling authority, and to issue bonds or notes of the Town therefor.

    "insertcomment": "The petitioner indicated that the implementation of Title VI, Article 7 of the Town Bylaw, the Arlington Residential Construction Agreement, also known as the “Good Neighbor Agreement”, has been inconsistent. The Good Neighbor Agreement, adopted by Town Meeting in 2017 and amended in 2019, applies to residential construction, including demolitions, open foundation excavation, new construction, and large additions, and requires notification by the contractor or property owner to abutters within a set period of time prior to any activities that may trigger the bylaw, including tree removal. The Good Neighbor Agreement establishes certain construction standards that must be maintained throughout the construction period. The addition of a cross reference in the Zoning Bylaw would improve implementation of the Good Neighbor Agreement.\n\n    The ARB found this addition to the Zoning Bylaw was unnecessary (in part because Title VI, Article 7, already contains the requirement that a demolition permit or building permit not issue until the requirements of that article are met) and determined that the proposed language does not align with the Town Bylaw. The ARB is concerned that this language may result in the application of the Good Neighbor Agreement to more projects than what the Town Bylaw indicates is required to comply with the Good Neighbor Agreement. The ARB recommended revising the language of Title VI, Article 7, to improve the implementation of the Good Neighbor Agreement before considering revising the Zoning Bylaw.",

Under the current bylaw, it would be virtually impossible for a new business to meet this requirement if it were situated on the north side of the block bordered by Park Avenue on the West, and Davis Rd. on the East. \n\n The Town has expressed a strong desire for three vigorous business districts in the East, Arlington Center,and Arlington Heights. In past years,a number of businesses have closed in the Heights business district, and the current parking bylaw makes it challenging for new businesses to enter the area. We believe that changing the existing bylaw would aid in encouraging the development of new businesses, and helping to create a vibrant and diverse commercial community in Arlington Heights.",
