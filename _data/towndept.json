At just under 5.5 square miles, Arlington is a dense community with three “main street” business districts. With quick access to neighboring communities via public transit, Arlington is an attractive community for people who work in nearby Boston and Cambridge’s elite universities, hospitals, and tech-related start-ups. As the starting point of the Minuteman Bikeway, Arlington has tremendous infrastructure for people who wish to commute by bike or cycle for leisure.  \n####Neighborhood Business Districts  \nLocated along Massachusetts Avenue and the Battle Road Byway, Arlington’s three neighborhood business districts provide opportunities for year-round shopping, dining, and recreation.  \n####Arlington Center  \nArlington Center is the town’s central business district and the western portion of the Arlington Cultural District. With dozens of restaurants, local retailers, two museums, the Regent Theatre and numerous other cultural institutions, there is always something to do in the Center. The neighborhood is at the heart of the Minuteman Bikeway and is well served by public transit including the 80 (Lechmere/Davis Square), 87 (Lechmere), 350 (Burlington), 77 (Harvard Square), and the 79 (Alewife Station) bus routes.  \n####Arlington Heights  \nArlington Heights is at the western end of town. Skirted by the Minuteman Bikeway, the Heights has restaurants, cafes, specialty retailers, and many thriving family-owned businesses.  The neighborhood is accessible by the MBTA and is served by routes 77 (Harvard Square), 78 (Harvard Square via Blanchard), and 79 (Alewife Station).  \nThe<a href='/home/showdocument?id=46654'>Arlington Heights Action Plan</a>  outlines the year-long planning process to analyze the Arlington Heights business district through the lens of zoning and other policies and practices to make recommendations for municipal actions to spur the revitalization of the Heights. The plan details six key recommendations focused on zoning, creating design standards, working with the MBTA to activate the bus depot, and to explore creative placemaking projects and community events. This plan is currently being implemented by the <a href='/town-governance/all-boards-and-committees/height-neighborhood-action-plan'>Arlington Heights Neighborhood Action Plan Implementation Committee</a> .  \n####East Arlington  \nEast Arlington is the town’s arts and culture hub and the eastern portion of the Arlington Cultural District. Home to the Capitol Theatre, several arts-focused retailers, excellent restaurants and galleries, East Arlington is a lively, bustling neighborhood boasting fantastic public art installations. With the Minuteman Bikeway running parallel to Mass Ave and surrounded by a dense residential neighborhood, it is accessible by car, bike, public transit, and on foot. Bus service routes include the 80 (Lechmere/Davis Square), 87 (Lechmere), 350 (Burlington), 77 (Harvard Square), and the 79 (Alewife Station) bus routes.  \n####Questions?  \nPlease contact Ali Carter at 781-316-3095 or<a href='mailto:ACarter@town.arlington.ma.us'>ACarter@town.arlington.ma.us</a> .  \n"

The dedicated officers of this Department are here to ensure that Arlington’s residents, visitors, commuters, and business owners, receive professional public safety services.  \nI believe that a police department is only as strong and successful as the community it serves. The men and women of the Arlington Police Department are committed to earning and enhancing the public's trust through professionalism and legitimacy. We have developed numerous partnerships with our residents, and a variety of community organizations, to address quality of life issues, and we strive to do this with dedication, and excellence.  \nThe Arlington Police Department is accredited by the Massachusetts Police Accreditation Commission, a voluntary process that ensures that our agency delivers services in line with 21century best practices in law enforcement. We are also a charter member of the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative, and our Arlington Outreach Initiative has become a national model of how to involve police in the substance use disorder recovery process.  \nThe Department is organized into three divisions: Operations and Community Services, Investigative Services and Professional Standards, and Support and Logistics, in order to deliver the highest level of quality services. In addition to our sworn police officers, we offer a wide array of services to meet the needs of our community, including a civilian crime analyst, and a mental health clinician.  The Arlington Police Department will continue to evolve and be prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.  \nAs chief, I am proud of the hard working members of the Arlington Police Department.
