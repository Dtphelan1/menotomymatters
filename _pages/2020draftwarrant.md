The 2020 Annual Town Meeting is approaching quickly, but the official warrant 
won't be published for several weeks yet.  However by digging through the 
town website, and through the help of [Bob Sprague of Your Arlington](https://www.yourarlington.com/) 
I've found all of the citizen-
proposed warrant articles here, as well as additional ones proposed by the town.  Since the warrant hasn't been built 
yet, none of the articles have numbers. 

**REMINDER:** these are **DRAFT** articles, manually transcribed from various 
submissions, and are **NOT OFFICIAL**.  Also, if anyone has corrections 
for them, please let me know.  Similarly, if you have useful links to additional 
information about these articles, or to relevant town board/committee 
meeting calendars, I'm happy to add them.

[See how I build this page](/tm/) or the [official Town Meeting page](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/town-meeting)
for details on the 2020 meeting (when posted).
