The 2020 Annual Town Meeting is approaching quickly, but the official warrant 
(or agenda) of topics won't be published for several weeks yet.  However 
through a helpful source I've gotten and transcribed all of the citizen-
proposed warrant articles here.  Since the warrant hasn't been built 
yet, none of the articles have numbers.  Note also that various town boards 
will also be proposing articles; however those submissions don't seem to 
be available yet.

**REMINDER:** these are **DRAFT** articles, manually transcribed from original 
paper submissions, and are **NOT OFFICIAL**.  Also, if anyone has corrections 
for them, please let me know.  Similarly, if you have useful links to additional 
information about these articles, or to relevant town board/committee 
meeting calendars, I'm happy to add them.

[See how I build this page](/tm/) or go see the [official Town Meeting page](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/town-meeting)
for details on the 2020 meeting (when posted).
