The 2020 Annual Town Meeting is finally coming after being [delayed due to the pandemic](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=51032).  By digging through the town website, and through the help of [Bob Sprague of Your Arlington](https://www.yourarlington.com/) I've compiled all draft articles proposed for this delayed town meeting.

**UPDATE** Along with delaying the meeting, [Town Moderator has announced significant changes](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=51032) to town meeting this year.  In particular, the moderator, in conjunction with town boards and various citizens who have submitted articles is planning to defer most non-financial warrant articles.  

**REMINDER:** these are **DRAFT** articles, manually transcribed from various 
submissions, and are **NOT OFFICIAL**.  Also, if anyone has corrections 
for them, please let me know.  Similarly, if you have useful links to additional 
information about these articles, or to relevant town board/committee 
meeting calendars, I'm happy to add them.
