The 2020 Special Town Meeting will be held in November with special COVID precautions to allow Town Meeting to consider the many non-time-critical Warrant Articles deferred from this summer's Annual Town Meeting.  This includes a variety of bylaws or zoning changes, along with a few other articles.

**THESE ARTICLES ARE DRAFTS**  The official Warrant for the Special Town Meeting hasn't been issued yet, so these articles are drafts.  However since they're mostly held-over from the previous meeting, the past data still stands.  Note that various town boards are likely to be meeting in the next few weeks to vote on their recommendations on various articles, so stay tuned!

There is also at least one newly submitted warrant article regarding the Black Lives Matter banner at Town Hall which is not yet included here - I'm waiting to get the official text.
