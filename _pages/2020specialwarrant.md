The 2020 Special Town Meeting will be held in November with special COVID precautions to allow Town Meeting to consider the many non-time-critical Warrant Articles deferred from this summer's Annual Town Meeting.  This includes a variety of bylaws or zoning changes, along with a few other articles.

This now includes the official text of the Special Town Meeting Warrant, and includes cross-references to various board or committee reports on articles where found.  Take special note of what articles appear on the consent agenda as well.
