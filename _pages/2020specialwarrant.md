The 2020 Special Town Meeting will be held in November with special COVID precautions to allow Town Meeting to consider the many non-time-critical Warrant Articles deferred from this summer's Annual Town Meeting.  This includes a variety of bylaws or zoning changes, along with a few other articles.

This now includes the official text of the Special Town Meeting Warrant, and includes cross-references to various board or committee reports on articles where found.  Take special note of what articles appear on the consent agenda as well.  The Town Meeting Moderator has provided an [introductory video for how this Special Town Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7kByMBt6Y8&list=PLztbi9KA9roW3HezeZdWRe92B5bCYq9nr&index=1) works.
