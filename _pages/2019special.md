The 2019 Special Town Meeting met last year at almost the same time as 
the normal [Annual Town Meeting](/tm/2019) with it's own agenda.  This 
Special Town Meeting was primarily driven by the Town Manager who added 
the 6 warrant articles about selling town property, capital budgets, 
and special zoning change proposals.

Here's an easy to read version of the full 2019 Special Town Meeting Warrant, 
with some annotations or comments added.  Note that amendments and 
changes during the meeting are not included.  [See how I build this page](/tm/).

For official (harder to read) copies of 2019 warrants, download 
or view them on the [official Town Meeting page](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/town-meeting).
