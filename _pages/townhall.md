Here's a handy listing of the when, where, and what about the most 
important town government committees.  The [Massachusetts Open Meeing Laws](https://www.mass.gov/the-open-meeting-law) 
means that you can always read the agendas and minutes, or even attend 
any town committee or board meetings.  Also, the local cable channel 
ACMi records key meetings and saves them on the [ACMi Government Channel](http://acmi.tv/govlive/)
for later viewing.
