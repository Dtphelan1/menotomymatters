Here's a handy listing of **all** town government committees, helping you understand what group does what and where to learn more about how they operate.  Meeting agendas aren't always easy to find, so I've also built a [handy meeting tracker](/meetings/) for some key committees.  This is a long list!  Remember, I'm always [happy to incorporate suggestions](mailto:shane@menotomymatters.com) to make this listing easier to understand.  All data here is derived from the official town website.
