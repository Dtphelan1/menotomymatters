Here's a handy listing of the when, where, and what about the most 
important town government committees.  The [Massachusetts Open Meeing Laws](https://www.mass.gov/the-open-meeting-law) 
means that you read the agendas and minutes, or even attend virtually 
all town committee or board meetings.  Also, the local cable channel 
ACMi records key meetings, and you can watch the [ACMi Government Channel](http://acmi.tv/govlive/) 
anytime to search for past recordings.
