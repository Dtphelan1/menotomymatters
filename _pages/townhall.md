Here's a handy listing of the most important town government committees, helping you understand what group does what and where to learn more about how they operate.  Meeting agendas aren't always easy to find, so I've also built a [handy meeting tracker](/meetings/) for some key committees.  
Remember, you can always watch recorded meetings on the [ACMi Government Channel](/acmi/) in your web browser!  

The [Employee Handbook for town employees](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=2212) (not necessarily covering governing boards) is also posted, as well as a set of [Employee Resources for the town](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=43397).
