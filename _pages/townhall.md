Here's a handy listing of the when, where, and what about the most 
important town government committees.  The [Massachusetts Open Meeting Laws](https://www.mass.gov/the-open-meeting-law) 
means that you can always read the agendas and minutes, or even attend 
any town committee or board meetings.  Or, just watch the recorded meetings 
of these committees on the [ACMi Government Channel](/acmi/)
in your web browser!

The [Employee Handbook for town employees](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=2212) (not necessarily covering governing boards) is also posted, as well as a set of [Employee Resources for the town](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=43397).
