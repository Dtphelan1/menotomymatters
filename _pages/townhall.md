Here's a handy listing of the when, where, and what about the most 
important town government committees.  The [Massachusetts Open Meeting Laws](https://www.mass.gov/the-open-meeting-law) 
means that you can always read the agendas and minutes, or even attend 
any town committee or board meetings.  Or, just watch the recorded meetings 
of these committees on the [ACMi Government Channel](http://acmi.tv/govlive/)
