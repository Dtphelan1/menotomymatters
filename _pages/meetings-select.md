Wondering what the [Select Board](/townhall/#select) does in their regular meetings?  Here's a detailed listing of recent Select Board agendas! 

All agendas were copied directly from the town website, and include links back to official downloads.  Agendas are presented here in an easy to read format, with direct links to legal minutes (once posted), to the recorded ACMi video, and to all supplementary materials.  The best way to really understand what happened at a particular meeting is to read through the entire Agenda PDF (long; they include correspondences), and then read through the Legal Minutes (which just describe decisions taken at the meeting).
