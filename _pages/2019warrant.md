The 2019 Annual Town Meeting met over several nights and considered over 70 
warrant articles, amendments, and other matters.  The same month, 
there was also a [Special Town Meeting](/tm/2019special) with its own agenda.

Here's an easy to read version of the full 2019 Annual Town Meeting Warrant, 
with various annotations added, including direct links to the town's 
original PDF documents for Supplemental Materials.  [See how I build this page](/tm/).
I'm still in the process of collating the actual pass/fail vote data 
from the 2019 meeting nights - stay tuned!
