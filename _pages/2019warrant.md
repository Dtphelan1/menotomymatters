The 2019 Annual Town Meeting met over several nights and considered over 70 
warrant articles, amendments, and other matters.  The same month, 
there was also a [Special Town Meeting](/tm/2019special) with its own agenda.

Here's an easy to read version of the full 2019 Annual Town Meeting Warrant, 
with various annotations added, including direct links to the town's 
original PDF documents for Supplemental Materials.  [See how I build this page](/tm/).
Note that I've added official vote totals to all warrant articles where 
I could clearly find the data in town records: it appears that several 
articles were either withdrawn or never voted on (or at least there aren't 
any published records of the votes).

For official (harder to read) copies of 2019 warrant, download 
or view them on the [official Town Meeting page](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/town-meeting).
