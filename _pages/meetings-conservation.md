Wondering what the [Conservation Commission](/townhall/#select) does in their regular meetings?  Here's a detailed listing of recent Conservation agendas, going back to November 2019 (when they started publishing a parseable format). 

All agendas were copied directly from the town website, and include links back to official downloads.  Agendas are presented here in an easy to read format, with direct links to legal minutes (once posted), and to all supplementary materials.  The best way to really understand what happened at a particular meeting is to read through the entire Agenda PDF (long; they include correspondences), and then read through the Legal Minutes (which just describe decisions taken at the meeting).
