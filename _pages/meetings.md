Wondering what the Redevelopment Board (ARB) or Select Board have been doing?  Find it hard to navigate the town's website to get to the details of what's happening in board meetings?  Try my new meeting tracker, making following along with current and past committee meetings in town simpler!

See my [guide to all the town hall committees](/townhall/)!

While the town website staff do a great job, the website software is not very end-user friendly.  While [Massachusetts Open Meeting Laws](https://www.mass.gov/the-open-meeting-law) ensures you _could_ get materials, _finding_ them requires going to several pages for each committee.  I've centralized all that, so you can see in one page a simple historical view of what a committee has done.  The handy synopsis includes direct links to all the official materials, but in an easier to use format.

I've also started indexing meeting agendas with [special building permit dockets](/meetings/arb/) and linking to bylaw changes proposed for the [town meeting warrant](/tm/2020/). 

## Town Board Meetings Trackers

Since I'm just starting on my road to simplifying transparency in town government, I've only finished work on the Redevelopment Board meetings so far.  Read the [**Redevelopment Board Meeting Tracker page**](/meetings/arb/), or the [Select Board Meeting Tracker](/meetings/select/) which shows all board agendas from 2020 thru 2018.

If there's interest, I will also analyze past meetings for other boards, and along with my existing work on [visualizing town meeting](/tm/).  Stay tuned on some tips for how to more easily follow town committee calendars, so you know when to dial-in to Zoom!
