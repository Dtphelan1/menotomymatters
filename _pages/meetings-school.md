Wondering what the [School Committee](/townhall/#school) does in their regular meetings?  Here's a detailed listing of recent School Committee agendas, including some of the many subcommittees. 

_News_ Read about [Arlington and nearby community School opening plans](/schools/school-opening-plans/) for 2020.

All agendas were copied directly from the town website, and include links back to official downloads.  Agendas are presented here in an easy to read format, with direct links to legal minutes (once posted), to the recorded ACMi video, and to all supplementary materials.  The best way to really understand what happened at a particular meeting is to read through the entire Agenda PDF (long; they include correspondences), and then read through the Legal Minutes (which just describe decisions taken at the meeting).

Note: This page only includes School Committee Regular, Special, or Organizational meetings.  It does not yet include any of the many Subcommittees of the School Committee (that's a lot of work to track).
