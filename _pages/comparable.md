When reviewing Arlington's budgets, staffing, or policies, it's often useful to be able to compare them to nearby or comparable towns.  The [Town Manager reports annually](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/departments/town-manager/town-manager-s-annual-budget-financial-report) how Arlington compares to a number of nearby comparable towns and cities.  I've researched landing pages for common services and a variety of police-related issues in all comparable and immediately adjacent towns to Arlington.
