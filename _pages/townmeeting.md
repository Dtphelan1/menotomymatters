Most of the work of Town Meeting is reviewing, discussing, and voting 
on Warrant articles at any Annual or Special meeting.  Warrant articles 
can cover a variety of topics, from changing town bylaws, approving budgets, 
or many other topics that either town boards/committees or any Town Meeting 
Member can submit to Town Meeting.

You've probably heard about many warrant articles if you've followed 
any Arlington politics, but how many articles have you really researched 
to see what the official reports or recommendations are?

## 2019 Town Meeting Full Articles And Votes

I've parsed the officially posted warrant articles for 2019 - both the 
normal [Annual Town Meeting](/tm/2019) as well as the simultaneous [Special Town Meeting](/tm/2019special) 
held last year.  All the data from the official warrant is here, plus 
some helpful annotations and links to other parts of town government.
This also includes official vote results for most articles. 
It appears that some articles were withdrawn or otherwise not voted 
on last year.

## 2020 Town Meeting DRAFT Articles And Reports

**New!** I've posted the [DRAFT 2020 articles](/tm/2020draft/) that will 
be presented to Town Meeting, as well as some of the recommendations from 
various town committees that have been made so far.  IMPORTANT: these 
are draft articles, and various town committees are still debating their 
recommendations or supplementary materials for them - so stay tuned for
updates.  I hope to bring you the key reports here as soon as I can 
find them, so we don't have to wait for the final official printing to 
start to research issues that matter. 

## What You'll Find About Articles

Every warrant article has links to the official sources on the town 
website, plus some additional annotations or comments that I've made 
(which obviously aren't official).  I hope to annotate this with voting 
data from past years as well, so someday we'll be able to easily see 
how each Town Meeting Member voted on various articles.  The data is all 
on the town website now - but it's certainly not easy to find.

Parsing the data from the town website requires a few manual steps, 
and then you can run my [ruby-based parsing code](/assets/code/warrantparser.rb) (offered under Apache-2.0).
The rest is all handled by this website's theme and Jekyll build.
