title: Town Meeting Warrant Articles
permalink: /tm/

Most of the work of Town Meeting is reviewing, discussing, and voting 
on Warrant articles at any Annual or Special meeting.  Warrant articles 
can cover a variety of topics, from changing town bylaws, approving budgets, 
or many other topics that either town boards/committees or any Town Meeting 
Member can submit to Town Meeting.

You've probably heard about many warrant articles if you've followed 
any Arlington politics, but how many articles have you really researched 
to see what the official reports or recommendations are?

I've parsed the officially posted warrant articles for 2019 - both the 
normal [Annual Town Meeting](/tm/2019) as well as the simultaneous [Special Town Meeting](/tm/2019special) 
held last year.  All the data from the official warrant is here, plus 
some helpful annotations and links to other parts of town government.

Every warrant article has links to the official sources on the town 
website, plus some additional annotations or comments that I've made 
(which obviously aren't official).  I hope to annotate this with voting 
data from past years as well, so someday we'll be able to easily see 
how each Town Meeting Member voted on various articles.  The data is all 
on the town website now - but it's certainly not easy to find.

Parsing the data from the town website requires a few manual steps, 
and then you can run my ruby-based parsing code (offered under Apache-2.0).
