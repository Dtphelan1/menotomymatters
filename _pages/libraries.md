Good news, book lovers: as of 30-June, Arlington's Robbins Library and libraries in Belmont, Lexington, Cambridge, Winchester, and more now are all open for scheduled pickup of held items.  No local libraries are open for in-person visits and browsing, but if you use the  [Minuteman Library Network's](https://www.minlib.net)  or the local library website, you can order, hold, and then pickup books again! 

Remember: there are a lot of [local bookstores offering delivery](/howto/covid-libraries/) too.
