Good news, book lovers: as of 30-June, Arlington's Robbins Library and libraries in Belmont, Lexington, Cambridge, Winchester, and more now are all open for scheduled pickup of held items.  No local libraries are open for in-person visits and browsing, but if you use the  [Minuteman Library Network's](https://www.minlib.net)  or the local library website, you can order, hold, and then pickup books again! 

The state has [detailed guidelines for libraries reopening during COVID](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/safety-standards-and-checklist-libraries#hygiene-protocols-), which mandates books returned be held for 24 hours before being put back in circulation.  Currently Robbins library is quarantining books for 3 days before scanning them into circulation - so unless you have special risks, you can read your books as soon as you pick them up!  The REALMS research project has shown [coronavirus is undetectable on common library materials after three days](https://www.imls.gov/news/research-shows-virus-undetectable-five-highly-circulated-library-materials-after-three-days).

Remember: there are a lot of [local bookstores offering delivery](/howto/covid-libraries/) too.
