There's been a lot of consternation about several rallies being held on Mass Ave today, Thursday September 10th.  Since there's also been a lot of confusion and unfounded assumptions about these events, here's a quick primer to the who, when, and where of these events, listed in order of them originally being announced.  In particular Facebook has a lot of allegations of alliances with other groups that don't have any evidence other than similarity in group names, so if you're curious, please read up on the event hosts directly.
