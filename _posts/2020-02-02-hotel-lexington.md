You may have heard about one developer's plans to build a new boutique 
hotel and restaurant at 1211 Mass Ave - although you might not know 
why it's going to be called 'Hotel Lexington' (I don't!).

If you're curious to know more, I've collected links to source documents 
and key newspaper articles in my [Issues about Hotel Lexington](/issues/hotellexington) page.

Briefly, a while back the town decided to sell it's parcel where the 
now defunct Disabled American Veteran's club is - between Leader Bank 
in the Heights and Nicolas.  A local developer who owns an adjoining 
lot made an agreement to purchase the town's lot, presuming they could 
all agree on zoning or other changes to build the hotel.

The original plans were presented last July; many questions were raised.  
The town's Redevelopment Board and the developer have been very slowly 
working on asking questions and updating the developer's proposal.

To follow along with what's happened so far, read about [Hotel Lexington issues](/issues/hotellexington). 

The **next action** on Hotel Lexington has been continued to the next 
[Redevelopment Board's meeting on March 16th, 2020](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/9931/3864?backlist=/town-governance/all-boards-and-committees/redevelopment-board).
