Welcome to Menotomy Matters, where Shane will be writing about town 
government in my home of Arlington, MA.  If you've ever wondered how 
to learn more about our town, or couldn't figure out how to make a 
request or find public records, then I hope to help.  Please 
see the [list of town resources](/resources/) I've collected, 
explore my [research on town issues](/issues/), or check out the 
[data visualization of past Town Meetings](/tm/) I've built.

I'm also running for Town Meeting in 2020!  I'll be coming around to households 
throughout the 12th district atop Arlington Heights soon to ask for 
your votes, and describe what I will do if elected as 
one of our precinct's four Town Meeting Members. 

The [town election will be Saturday, April 4th, 2020](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting), and the 12th precinct votes at the Brackett School.
