Our town is currently in the middle of a major project to completely rebuild 
the Arlington High School.  You've certainly heard about different parts 
of the process - whether the design, the green features, the timing 
of construction, or of course **the cost**.  This is a complicated subject,
and there are a lot of both citizen groups advocating for various things, 
as well as different town or state groups with official plans or budgets.

I've started collecting some of the key links to understand what's going 
on over in my [Issues page about the AHS Rebuild](/issues/ahsrebuild) - please check it out, 
and let me know if you have key links to add!

If you're in a hurry, the most important thing to read is the 
[Town's official AHS Rebuild website](http://ahsbuilding.org/), which 
inclues basic links to all current parts of the plan, construction dates, 
budgets, and more.  For other source documents and news stories, 
see my [AHS Rebuild issues page](/issues/ahsrebuild).

Currently, the next meeting for the [AHS Rebuild Committee will be March 3rd, 2020](https://ahsbuilding.org/event/ahs-building-committee-57/).
