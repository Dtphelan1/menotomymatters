Here at Menotomy Matters, Shane is workign to bring transparency to town 
government - either by finding actual source records (instead of rumors)
about town issues, or showing you how to get things done with Arlington
town departments.

I've got a lot of ideas about what I think should be simpler or easier to 
find in our town, but **what about your ideas**?  What are you interested 
in learning about town government, or what seemingly-simple task have 
you been wanting to do, but can't figure out how to do it?

## Try The Search Bar

The first tip is to go to the town website, and use the search bar at the 
far top right of the town's homepage to search
for the topic you're curious about.  While the results presented aren't 
always as well organized as a good Google search tends to be, you 
can find a lot of good nuggets of information on the town website:

## Use The Request Tool

While it may feel good to ask the Arlington List for help getting something 
done, if you want town government to respond, it's usually better to use 
the formal Request/Answer Center to ask - unless of course the town department 
you need already has a specific form to fill out.

First, use the "I want to..." menu on the town website:

If what you need isn't there, then try submitting a Request here:
