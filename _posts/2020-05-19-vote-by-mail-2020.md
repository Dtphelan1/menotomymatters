**UPDATE** Two of the ballot boxes have been moved, see new map locations below.

We all know [town elections are postponed until June 6th](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/elections).  While most polling locations will still be open, there's a lot of interest in how to vote by mail with an absentee ballot this year, and questions about how to so, and what do do with your postcard.

**NEW!** Hear me explain [how to vote this year on ACMi News' latest election video coverage](https://www.facebook.com/acminews/videos/591264048434976/)!

## What Is Changing With The June Town Elections?

**REMEMBER:** check the [Town Clerk's Elections & Voting page for election information](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting), especially this year, with their [detailed updated 2020 voting information](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome)!  Always _confirm official election information_ with the Town Clerk, or for state elections, with the [MA Secretary of State office](http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elevoterresources.htm).

## How Do I Vote By Mail?

Due to COVID-19, [state regulations have changed](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/eleev/evidx.htm) allowing _any voter_ to do "early voting by mail", which is almost identical to the normal absentee ballot.  The Town Clerk's office has simplified the process, by [sending every registered voter a postcard](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome) with a prepaid return postcard - you should get your postcard very soon, if not already.  The first step is to is sign the return postcard and send it back **now**.

**FIRST:** When you get your Return your [Arlington Election Commission Ballot Request postcard](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome), fill out the fields at the bottom, and sign it.  Then drop it in a normal USPS post box to mail it back to the town clerk.  Do **not** bring it to town hall, you should mail it.

**SECOND:** Wait about a week.  Once the Town Clerk gets your request postcard, they will mail you an "early voting by mail" ballot to your registered voter address (unless you specifically listed a different address on your postcard).  That may take several days in the mail, although it's reported the Town Clerk is working fast on sending them out!

**THIRD:** When you get your official ballot in the mail - which should have an official town seal and come from the Arlington Election Commission!, take a breath and _research_ the candidates.  The ballot should look similar to ballots you get in person, but there are a lot of contested races this year!

- Bob Sprague's [Your Arlington has candidate profiles](https://www.yourarlington.com/arlington-archives/town-school/elections/), debates, letters, and more.
- Arlington's [League Of Women Voters](http://www.lwva.com) has candidate profiles for most (but not all).

**FOURTH:** Fill out the official ballot carefully - it will be difficult to get a replacement.  Remember that some races you get a single vote; some races you get two or more votes.  Double check your votes.

**FIFTH:** Carefully put your official ballot into the postpaid envelope that came with it, and then you can **either**:

- Mail it back via the USPS.  Remember to allow for mailing delays; ballots **must** get to the Town Clerk in time to be counted!
- Drop the ballot _in it's envelope_ into one of the black "Official Ballot Drop Box" boxes setup by the town in three locations:
  - East Arlington, [Fox Library]([CV45+68 Arlington, Massachusetts](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Edith+M+Fox+Library/@42.4055899,-71.143845,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e376fe34330bb7:0xd92f150fc174b932!8m2!3d42.405586!4d-71.141651)), 175 Mass. Avenue
  - [Arlngton Center at Town Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Robbins+Memorial+Town+Hall/@42.4158888,-71.1585642,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e376501bc60af3:0xb40dbfbab152d8b1!8m2!3d42.4158849!4d-71.1563702), on the front steps.
  - Arlington Heights, [ACMI Studio/Dallin Library, 85 Park Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arlington+Community+Media+Inc./@42.4238679,-71.185872,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e3762456867c57:0x5d268b9dcaa889c9!8m2!3d42.423864!4d-71.183678)

**UPDATE** Two Ballot Boxes have just been moved for security reasons; the map links above are the **new** locations, and the one of ACMi ata 58 Park is updated, but I haven't updated the East Arlington picture yet.  I'll try to go out soon to take new pictures! 

Phew, you're done!  Sorry, I don't know where they'll be handing out I Voted stickers for vote-by-mail!

## Voting In Person - Yes, You Can!

Even with COVID-19, yes, you still can cast a ballot in person on June 6th if you don't vote by mail!  Current reports show that most polling places will be open on Saturday, June 6th, although a few polls will be moved to other polling locations.  Stay tuned to the [Town Clerk's Elections page](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting) to see which locations are being moved. 

Reminder: [Town Meeting is also be postponed](/townmeeting/town-meeting-during-covid/) until after the election.
