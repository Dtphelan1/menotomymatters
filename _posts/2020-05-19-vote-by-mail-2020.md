We all know [town elections are postponed until June 6th](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/elections).  While most polling locations will still be open, there's a lot of interest in how to vote by mail with an absentee ballot this year, and questions about how to so, and what do do with your postcard.

## What Is Changing With The June Town Elections?

**FIRST:** check the [Town Clerk's Elections & Voting page for election information](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting), especially this year, with their [updated 2020 voting information](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome)!  Always _confirm official election information_ with the Town Clerk, or for state elections, with the [MA Secretary of State office](http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elevoterresources.htm).

## How Do I Vote By Mail?

Due to COVID-19, state regulations have changed allowing any voter to request a vote-by-mail ballot, often called an absentee ballot.  The Town Clerk's office has simplified the process, by [sending every registered voter a postcard](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome) with a prepaid return postcard - you should get your postcard very soon, if not already.  The first step is to is sign the return postcard and send it back **now**.

Return your [Arlington Election Commission postcard](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome) **now** to get a vote-by-mail ballot!  You'll need to wait a week or so to get your **official ballot** in the mail, which will have a postage paid return envelope.

Then, when you get your **actual ballot** (which should look similar to normal ballots), be sure to fill it out and return it **promptly**, to make sure it gets back to the Town Clerk well _before_ the election on 6-June.  You can mail it back (remember to leave time for the mail!) or turn it in by hand to one of the [three "Official Ballot Drop Box" that the Town is setting up](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome) around town.  They are currently scheduled to be setup at:

- East Arlington: Mass Ave and Lake St (corner by Winter Street)
- Arlington Center: Town Hall, lower plaza (before front steps)
- Arlington Heights: Park and Mass Ave (corner by clock)

See a picture of these [new black ballot drop boxes](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/News/News/10198/16?backlist=%2fhome) on the Town Clerk's page.

## Polling Place Changes

Even with COVID-19, yes, you still can cast a ballot in person!  Current reports show that most polling places will be open on Saturday, June 6th, although a few polls will be moved to other polling locations.  Stay tuned to the [Town Clerk's Elections page](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting) to see which locations are being moved. 

Reminder: [Town Meeting is also be postponed](/townmeeting/town-meeting-during-covid/) until after the election.
