Hello!  My name is Shane Curcuru, and I'm running for Town Meeting in the 12th Precinct atop the Heights, because 
I want to see more transparency in town government.  If elected to TMM, 
I will publicly blog every issue I research, and try to explain what
the various warrant articles _actually_ mean.

We have a great town, and some great people working for the town and volunteering 
on various committees.  But it's still to hard to understand what's 
going on in various meetings or behind the scenes.  My goal is to help Arlingtonians 
find all the source documents behind the committee meeting agendas, and 
help you understand what they really mean.

**Remember:** [Town election day is Saturday, April 4th](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting)!
Please make sure to vote, no matter what Precinct you're in, since there 
are several important and competitive Town elections this year.  
Also, I hope if you're in the 12th Precinct, you'll vote for Shane 
as one of your four choices for Town Meeting!

## Out Of Town Election Day April 4th?

No worries - voting an absentee ballot is easy.  You can either get one 
in person at the Town Clerk's office (second floor, Town Hall), or 
mail or scan in your [Absentee Ballot Application](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=49768) to town hall.

## Have More Questions  ?

If you've got other questions either about how to get things done with 
town government, or questions about what I'd do as a Town Meeting Member 
in the 12th Precinct, let me know at [alist@shanecurcuru.org](mailto:alist@shanecurcuru.org?Subject=[MM] Campaign Question)!
