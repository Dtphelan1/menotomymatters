Hello!  My name is Shane Curcuru, and I'm candidate for Town Meeting in the 12th Precinct atop the Heights, because I want to see more **transparency in town government**.  If elected to TMM, 
I will publicly blog every issue I research, and try to explain what
the various warrant articles _actually_ mean.  See the 
[draft 2020 warrant articles now](https://menotomymatters.com/tm/2020draft/) with comments from various boards!

We have a great town, and some great people working for the town and volunteering 
on various committees.  But it's still to hard to understand what's 
going on in different meetings or behind the scenes.  My goal is to help Arlingtonians 
find all the source documents behind the committee meeting agendas, and 
help you understand what they really mean.  An informed citizenry is the 
most important thing to keep town meeting and democracy working well.

**Remember:** [Town election day is Saturday, April 4th](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting)!
Please make sure to vote, no matter what Precinct you're in, since there 
are several important and competitive Town elections this year.  
Also, I hope if you're in the 12th Precinct, you'll vote for Shane 
as one of your four choices for Town Meeting!

## Out Of Town Election Day April 4th? Just Want To Vote Absentee?

**UPDATE** The town clerk has noted that anyone can now request an 
Absentee Ballot - if you do it before the deadline.  You can even fill 
out, sign, and scan/take a photo of the application, and then 
[email it into the town clerk](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/BusinessDirectory/BusinessDirectory/35/) to have a ballot mailed to you.  Be sure to 
allow enough time for it to go through the mail!

No worries - voting an absentee ballot is easy.  You can either get one 
in person at the Town Clerk's office (second floor, Town Hall), or 
mail or scan in your [Absentee Ballot Application](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=49768) to town hall.

## Have More Questions  ?

If you've got other questions either about how to get things done with 
town government, or questions about what I'd do as a Town Meeting Member 
in the 12th Precinct, let me know at [shane@menotomymatters.com](mailto:shane@menotomymatters.com?Subject=[MM] Campaign Question)!
