## We Need To Get Organized

Arlington neighbors are doing some amazing things to help each other out 
this past week.  Besides the widely-read Arlington List and the many
[Arlington Facebook groups](https://menotomymatters.com/howto/covid-emergency/#resource-lists---where-to-get-help), I've seen a half-dozen lists or spreadsheets 
of other good local resources or ways to help.

These are all great things to do, but what we need is a meta-organization 
that helps neighbors more easily find resources, volunteer in specific 
areas, and then connect people to get help.  Doing this meta-organizing 
will multiply the efficiency of all the great people volunteering - but 
it will take effort and organization from a core team that can work 
together, and includes at least some technical skills.

## One Way To Meta-Organize

Medford and Somerville have done an amazing job in building their site:

- [**https://mutualaidmamas.com/**](https://mutualaidmamas.com/) ([on FB](https://www.facebook.com/MutualAidMAMAS/))

This uses a set of Google docs of different kinds to help organize 
both specific kinds of volunteers (drivers, cash, shopping, etc.) as 
well as hyper-local pods and the like.  They've even translated a lot 
of the site and subpages into Spanish so far!

What's really impressive is they've built a Google Doc that 
explains how to [replicate their system for other communities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ca-sz4DRNvUg8ezcrfd6awH-ahxBDJwnbdzxm4_qDVs/edit)!  I would love to get started on this!

## Can You Help?

There are many different Google docs or Facebook volunteer groups in Arlington - but there isn't a good way to find all of them (especially if you don't use Facebook).  

So please check out **[mutualaidarlington.org](https://mutualaidarlington.org)** where I'm collecting links to all local volunteer groups, and am actively [looking for volunteers to help meta-coordinate](https://forms.gle/uwiPfacsSabgk9v67) all the other great volunteer groups in Arlington.

Bonus: [Support Local Businesses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H8XgJ5soHNKMIpXmyrfP3BHs0nHHx2Rb9IVxCRqIl9g/edit?fbclid=IwAR3cC1Yv_uMDlcDeqt4FaIKLn2-mSLyAaVc1tKxt0ZKuPJcRu-0umLH5LJ0#gid=968014385) is a Google Spreadsheet of various kinds of local Arlington/Lexington area businesses that are still open - often for take-out or drive-up service.  Help them out!

There's a huge [list of technology and organizing resources](https://coronavirustechhandbook.com/) from the UK.
