## We Need To Get Organized

Arlington neighbors are doing some amazing things to help each other out 
this past week.  Besides the widely-read Arlington List and the many
[Arlington Facebook groups](https://menotomymatters.com/howto/covid-emergency/#resource-lists---where-to-get-help), I've seen a half-dozen lists or spreadsheets 
of other good local resources or ways to help.

These are all great things to do, but what we need is a meta-organization 
that helps neighbors more easily find resources, volunteer in specific 
areas, and then connect people to get help.  Doing this meta-organizing 
will multiply the efficiency of all the great people volunteering - but 
it will take effort and organization from a core team that can work 
together, and includes at least some technical skills.

## One Way To Meta-Organize

Medford and Somerville have done an amazing job in building their site:

- [**https://mutualaidmamas.com/**](https://mutualaidmamas.com/) ([on FB](https://www.facebook.com/MutualAidMAMAS/))

This uses a set of Google docs of different kinds to help organize 
both specific kinds of volunteers (drivers, cash, shopping, etc.) as 
well as hyper-local pods and the like.  They've even translated a lot 
of the site and subpages into Spanish so far!

What's really impressive is they've built a Google Doc that 
explains how to [replicate their system for other communities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ca-sz4DRNvUg8ezcrfd6awH-ahxBDJwnbdzxm4_qDVs/edit)!  I would love to get started on this!

## Can You Help?

This is something I've love to get started, but ironically I just 
put my back out and have limited time for typing this week.  Is there 
anyone else out there who wants to work on duplicating the kind of 
meta-organization that Medford and Somerville have here in Arlington?

Personally, I'm unemployed and a 20-year [open source coder and community organizer](http://shanecurcuru.org/); 
I've been volunteering at the ASF for over 20 years 
and have plenty of experience helping out.  But this kind of work needs 
a team of people - some who can do the "good enough" technical setup 
to have an effective website, and some who can do the community work
of corraling various exising volunteer efforts to work with them together.

In particular, we don't need "just one group" - that makes coordinating 
the admins who run technical or privacy issues complicated.  We need a 
meta-group who can easily point to various existing volunteer efforts, 
many of whom may already have their own way of doing things.

**Does that make sense?  Who wants to help?**

I've registered **mutualaidarlington.org** as a homepage for this effort, 
and will ensure it links to wherever we get meta-organized.

## Other Great Resources? What Should I Add?

If you have other good resources, or other groups that are already 
doing meta-organizing around Arlington volunteers, let me know!

If you're on Github': just click "Propose change on GitHub" to make a PR. 
Otherwise, email [shane@menotomymatters.com](mailto:shane@menotomymatters.com?Subject=[MM] COVID-19 Emergency Suggestion) with your suggestions.
