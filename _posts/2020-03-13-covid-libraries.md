## Most Library Facilities Closed

All [Minuteman Library Network](https://www.minlib.net) libraries are now closed due to [COVID-19 health issues](/howto/covid-info/).  So it's time to think outside the library, for online resources, or break down and buy used books if you can afford it!

## Online Library Resources

With your library card (NOTE: local libraries offer free online signup for a new card!), you can still read books on your devices:

- NEW! Robbins Library cards can now get a [free Hoopla account for reading books online](https://buff.ly/2IYOj8G) if you sign up!
- See [Boston Public Library online resources](https://www.bpl.org/news/covid-19-update-march-16th/) like Kanopy, Hoopla, and lynda.com.
- Try the [Minuteman Overdrive application](https://minuteman.overdrive.com/) to read on your device!  
- Or see the newer [Libby library reader app](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/?utm_origin=lightning&utm_page_genre=tout&utm_list=meet_libby&utm_content=libby_tout_learnmore_06019018) for Android/iPhone.
- Don't have a library card, or lost yours?  [Register for a new Minuteman library number online](https://library.minlib.net/selfreg) or [get a BPL eCard online](https://www.bpl.org/ecard/)!
- There are over a dozen [Free Little Libraries scattered around Arlington](https://littlefreelibrary.org/ourmap/), for book trading with neighbors.

Many people are collecting lists of **online learning resources**, here's one giant list to start with: 

[**Google Spreadsheet of Education companies offering free subscriptions during COVID**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUKLZN7hGSu1Hzm70kfzBKs-lsSELaEMggS60Bi2O2I/htmlview?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwAR00tz_I0D6EgvfDUVd3JDa-PJ1mu-hwV-iXWBd2siENLhPE6ZI6SO6rUOk&sle=true)

## Local Bookstores

Several local bookstores now offer delivery or pickup.

- [The Book Rack](http://www.book-rack.com/covid-update/) is closed to customers, will be doing online orders starting Tuesday
- [Belmont Books](https://www.belmontbooks.com/free-delivery?shane), in downtown Belmont, offers free delivery on $25 orders
- [Book Ends](https://bookendswinchester.indielite.org/) in Winchester center appears open still
- [Porter Square Books](https://www.portersquarebooks.com/) also offers free shipping on some orders
- [Harvard Book Store](http://www.harvard.com/updates_on_covid-19) also offers free shipping, and is open reduced hours

There are also several great online used bookstores that have great prices and selection - if you're desperate for new books, but don't want to pay Amazon or Barnes & Noble prices, check out [Better Worlds Books](http://i.refs.cc/piF3oBiZ?smile_ref=eyJzbWlsZV9zb3VyY2UiOiJzbWlsZV91aSIsInNtaWxlX21lZGl1bSI6IiIsInNtaWxlX2NhbXBhaWduIjoicmVmZXJyYWxfcHJvZ3JhbSIsInNtaWxlX2N1c3RvbWVyX2lkIjo0NTQwNzE3MDd9) (my referral link for $5 off a $30 order, they're a certified B corporation!), [Abe Books](https://www.abebooks.com/books/used-books.shtml), or [ALibris](https://www.alibris.com/books) for ideas.
