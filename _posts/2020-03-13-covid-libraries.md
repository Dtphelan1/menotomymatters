## Nearest Open Libraries

I'm working on a map covering all [Minutman Library Network libraries](https://www.minlib.net/) 
and their open/close status - stay tuned!

## Buying Books

- [Belmont Books is offering free delivery to Arlington](https://www.belmontbooks.com/free-delivery?shane) on orders over $25 - a great way for a local business to support us!
- [Craft Beer Cellar Belmont](https://belmont.craftbeercellar.com/) also has free local delivery, and they'll even deliver your Belmont Books books too!

## Other Great Resources? Send In Updates!

If you have other good resources - especially from government sources 
or with serious scientific backing - please send them in, I'll update this.  
Similarly, if you are working on a resource list, or have a volunteer 
list to help people stuck at home, let me know and I can link it.
