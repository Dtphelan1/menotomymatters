## Most Library Facilities Closed

Nearly all of the [Minuteman Library Network's](https://www.minlib.net) libraries are now closed due to [COVID-19 health issues](/howto/covid-info/).  Boston Public Libraries, and libraries and Ashland and Holliston may still be open - See the [updated listing of open libraries nearby](/libraries/).

## Online Library Resources

With your library card, you can still read books on your devices:

- Try the [Minuteman Overdrive application](https://minuteman.overdrive.com/) to read on your device!  
- Or see the newer [Libby library reader app](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/?utm_origin=lightning&utm_page_genre=tout&utm_list=meet_libby&utm_content=libby_tout_learnmore_06019018) for Android/iPhone.
- Don't have a library card, or lost yours?  [Register for a new library number online](https://library.minlib.net/selfreg)!
- There are over a dozen [Free Little Libraries scattered around Arlington](https://littlefreelibrary.org/ourmap/), for book trading with neighbors.
