## Local Government Resources

- The [CDC still has excellent advice](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), even in the face of reports of not enough tests.
- [CDC Fact Sheets, including in Spanish and Chinese](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/factsheets.html).

- [The World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) provides resources in other languages, like Arabic, French, Russian, and more.

## Scientific And Trusted News Resources

There are a lot of scientists working on this - a lot of scammers too.  
Check sources before sending articles along - it's almost always worth finding 
the underlying scientific report or alert, instead of sharing that clickbait 
article on some website you found.

- The [Lancet's respected scientific journals](https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus) coverage of COVID-19.
- [WHO's meta-listing of scientific papers on COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov).
- [New York Times coverage on COVID-19](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) is now **free for all** (not paywalled).
- [NPR's guide on preparing your home](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/26/809650625/a-guide-how-to-prepare-your-home-for-coronavirus).
- This [well-researched Medium article by Tomas Pueyo](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) gives a good overview of the larger implications of COVID-19.
- [Bob Sprague's Your Arlington](https://www.yourarlington.com/) is worth reading regularly for hyper-local Arlington news.

## Data Visualizations Related To COVID-19

There are a **lot** of fancy data maps or visualizations tracking the 
spread of COVID-91, including one by a high school student.  A handful
 of ones from well-researched sources are here:

- [Johns Hopkins public health](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) has one of the [best datasets and visualizations](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).
- [The COVID19 Tracker team (from the Atlantic)](https://covidtracking.com/) are also analyzing detailed US data.
- [Tableau software offers free visualizations](https://www.tableau.com/covid-19-coronavirus-data-resources) you can re-use.
- [Datawrapper software also has some free reusable charts](https://blog.datawrapper.de/coronaviruscharts/#column-chart-Germany).
