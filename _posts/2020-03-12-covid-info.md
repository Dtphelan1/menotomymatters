## Local Government Resources

- The [CDC still has excellent advice](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), even in the face of reports of not enough tests.
- [CDC Fact Sheets, including in Spanish and Chinese](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/factsheets.html).
- [Mass Department of Public Health information page](https://www.mass.gov/2019coronavirus) lists local resources, with updates our the MA State of Emergency
- [Boston Public Library has a great list of resources](https://www.bpl.org/blogs/post/covid-19-resources/) too.
- [The World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) provides resources in other languages, like Arabic, French, Russian, and more.

## Scientific And Trusted News Resources

There are a lot of scientists working on this - a lot of scammers too.  
Check sources before sending articles along - it's almost always worth finding 
the underlying scientific report or alert, instead of sharing that clickbait 
article on some website you found.

- The [Lancet's respected scientific journals](https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus) coverage of COVID-19.
- [WHO's meta-listing of scientific papers on COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov).
- [New York Times coverage on COVID-19](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/coronavirus) is now **free for all** (not paywalled).
- [NPR's guide on preparing your home](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/26/809650625/a-guide-how-to-prepare-your-home-for-coronavirus).
