Welcome to Menotomy Matters, where Shane will be writing about town 
government in my home of Arlington, MA.  If you've ever wondered how 
to learn more about our town, or couldn't figure out how to make a 
request or find public records, then I hope to help.

I'm also running for Town Meeting!  I'll be coming around to households 
throughout the 12th district atop Arlington Heights soon to ask for 
your votes, and describe what I hope to improve if elected as 
one of our precinct's four Town Meeting Members. 

The [town election will be Saturday, April 4th, 2020](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/elections-voting), and the 12th precinct votes at the Brackett School.
