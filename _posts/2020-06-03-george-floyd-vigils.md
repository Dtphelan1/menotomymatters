After the [recent death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd), there have been protests and vigils around the world attempting to make positive change to the systemic racism across the US.  There are plenty of opportunities to join in solidarity locally.

## Local Protests

Whether for George Floyd, or Black Lives Matter, or for reducing police-initiated violence, virtually every town near us has been having protests in some ways.  Here are some of the ones in and around Arlington.

- [**Arlington** Stand in Solidarity](https://www.facebook.com/groups/160644117397/permalink/10158253455132398/) - **6-7PM every night, continuing**, all along Mass Ave.  Started by Isa Dray, AHS Grad, and continued by other grads and teens alike, this appears to be growing nightly.
- [**Belmont** Virtual Unity Vigil, Thursday June 4th, 2020 7pm](hhttps://sites.google.com/view/belmontrc/unity?authuser=0) Starts as an online viewing of streamed talks from town officials and local leaders, Belmontonians will light candles at home afterwards.
- **Watertown** has [held a vigil in Watertown Square](https://www.facebook.com/UnityBreakfast/posts/2895119743941806)
- **Lexington** held a [vigil along Mass Ave](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/interfaith-vigil-and-protest-for-george-floyd-in-lexington/ar-BB150ubp)

I'm sure there are more events - if you have them for towns **immediately adjacent** to Arlington, [let me know](mailto:shane@menotomymatters.com?Subject=George Floyd Vigil) and I'll add pointers.

## Local Government Statements

Police departments and town governments alike are making statements condemning George Floyd's murder, as well as discussing their actions to improve local policing.

## Advocacy Resources

There are plenty of different advocacy groups out there, here are just a couple of the key ones that I've been following.

- [Arlington Fights Racism](https://www.arlingtonfightsracism.com/) is a local group with a slate of candidates in our current election.
- [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) is a key international coordinating group for racial justice with a [local Boston chapter](https://blacklivesmatterboston.org/).
- [Campaign Zero](https://www.joincampaignzero.org/) is a group working to end police violence, with a number of sub-projects focused on specific areas.

This will be (and has been, since the founding of the US) a long and painful process.  The key will be to use this pain, energy, and international attention and pivot to effective changes that will make the lasting systemic impacts needed in both our governments (at all levels) and our culture.
