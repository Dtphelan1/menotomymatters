## Comparable Towns

The towns I've researched include all of Arlington's immediate neighbors, plus "comparable" towns.  Here, I'm using the same list of towns/cities that the [Town Manager uses in Annual Reports](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/departments/town-manager/town-manager-s-annual-budget-financial-report): Arlington, Belmont, Brookline, Medford, Melrose, Milton, Natick, Needham, North Andover, Reading, Stoneham, Watertown, Winchester.  I've also included our immediate neighbors: Lexington, Cambridge, and Somerville, since they may be of interest.
