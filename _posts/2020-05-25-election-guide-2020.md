Debating how to vote?  The best way to learn about the candidates is to read their own words or watch the interviews - not to read Facebook comments.  To help, here's a list of **all** the major positions, including detailed Your Arlington interviews and some great ACMi profiles - well worth a watch!

**UPDATE** Read my [step-by-step guide for voting by mail](/townmeeting/vote-by-mail-2020/), including map to three ballot drop boxes.
