There's been a lot of discussion recently about town leadership and planning, especially in relation to some [controversial zoning and development projects](/issues/) being proposed.  It might be useful for some frequent A-List writers or Facebook group posters to also look around on the town website to either read the many existing town plans, or to [get involved with town committees](/townhall/) in forming future plans or decisions.  Actions may not always follow existing plans closely, but it's still informative to see what town committees or departments **said** they were planning when reviewing what _actually_ happens.
