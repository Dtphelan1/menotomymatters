A developer is proposing to buy a town property and build a new boutique hotel and restaurant at 1211 Mass Ave, between Leader Bank and the old Nicola's restaurant.  The proposal is complicated, involving the town selling
a parcel to the developer (making money for the town) pending an agreement 
on various zoning and redevelopment approvals.  See the facts or reporting below, 
or read my [preliminary blog post about the Hotel Lexington](/business/hotel-lexington/).
