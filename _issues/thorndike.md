One of David Mugar's development companies is proposing to build a 207 unit apartment building and townhouses as a 40B development [between Dorothy Road, Burtch Street, the Thorndike dog park, and Route 2](https://goo.gl/maps/daMnTPjuFHX99m347).  Plans for developing this property have stretched for years.  In 2015, the [town objected to the developer's plans](https://yourarlington.com/arlington-archives/town-school/selectboard/7946-mugar-081915.html), after which the developer applied for 40B status to bypass many local zoning restrictions.

This is a large and complex project attempting to add housing atop a wetland area, and directly butting up against some local residences.  Several local advocacy groups are each working to oppose this development on various fronts.  Now, in mid-2020, the development planning is going before the [Zoning Board of Appeals](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/all-boards-and-committees/zoning-board-of-appeals) with new questions.
