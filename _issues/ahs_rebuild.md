Arlington is in the middle of a multi-year capital campaign to comprehensively 
rebuild the older and too-small High School on Mass Ave.  Even with the 
press coverage and controversies around the project, it's still difficult 
to follow along, especially to find source documents about plans, rather 
than just rumors or speculation.

Here's a partial list of useful resources - either town documents, news 
sites, or other.
